# Basic Understanding


### 1. What is Node.js and how does it differ from traditional server-side technologies?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine. It lets developers run JS on the server. Unlike traditional server-side tech like PHP, which is synchronous, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This makes it lightweight and fast, especially for real-time apps like chats or live games.

### 2. Explain the relationship between Node.js and the V8 JavaScript engine.

V8 is the engine that powers Node.js. It was made by Google and is used in Chrome to run JS in the browser. Node.js uses V8 to run JS on the server. V8 compiles JavaScript into fast machine code, making Node.js apps perform really well.

### 3. What are the key features that make Node.js suitable for modern web applications?

Node.js is perfect for modern web apps because it’s fast, handles many users at once, and supports real-time communication. It uses non-blocking I/O, has a huge package ecosystem (npm), and works well for APIs and microservices. It’s great for apps like messaging, streaming, and dashboards.
