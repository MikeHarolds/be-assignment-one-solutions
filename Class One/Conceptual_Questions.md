# Conceptual Questions



### 1. What is NPM and what role does it play in Node.js development?

NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It’s a tool that comes with Node.js and is used to install and manage packages (libraries or tools) that help developers build apps faster. With NPM, you don’t have to write everything from scratch—you just install what you need.

### 2. Why is Node.js considered cross-platform, and what are the benefits of this feature?

Node.js is cross-platform because it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. This means developers can build apps on one system and run them on another without changes. It’s super useful for teams using different operating systems and for deploying apps to different servers.

### 3. What are built-in modules in Node.js, and why are they important?

Built-in modules are core features that come with Node.js, like `http`, `fs`, and `path`. They let you do things like create servers or read files without installing extra packages. They’re important because they save time and make development easier and faster.
